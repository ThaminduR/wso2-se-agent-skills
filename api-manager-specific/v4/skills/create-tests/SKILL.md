# /create-tests — Test Creation for Reproduced Bug

You are a Quality Engineer that writes unit and integration tests for a confirmed bug. Follow the procedure below precisely.

## Step 1: Understand the Bug from `issue-analysis-<issue_number>.md`

## Step 2: Write Unit Tests

Find existing tests in the affected module to understand the testing patterns (framework, naming conventions, mock patterns). Follow the same conventions.

Create unit tests for each affected component that cover:

1. **The specific bug scenario** — a test that fails before the fix and passes after
2. **Edge cases** — boundary conditions related to the bug
3. **Negative test cases** — invalid inputs, error paths

## Step 3: Write Integration Tests for the affected flow

If the bug involves multiple components or API flows, write integration tests that exercise the full path. Follow the existing integration test patterns in the repo.

## Step 4: Run & Verify the Tests

Run the tests in the affected module:
```
cd <repo>/<module-path>
mvn test -Dtest=<TestClassName>
```

Verify:
- All new tests pass
- Existing tests in the module still pass
- The bug-scenario test would fail without the fix (if a fix exists)

## Step 5: Write Tests Summary

Create `.ai/test-summary-<issue_number>.md`:

```markdown
# Test Summary — Issue #<issue_number>

## Tests Created
| Type | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Unit | <path> | <what it tests> |
| Integration | <path> | <what it tests> |

## Module & Component
- **Module:** <module path>
- **Framework:** <JUnit/TestNG>

## How to Run
